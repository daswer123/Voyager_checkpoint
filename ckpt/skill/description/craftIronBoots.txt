async function craftIronBoots(bot) {
    // The function crafts iron boots using 4 iron ingots. If there are not enough iron ingots in the inventory, it mines iron ores and smelts them in a furnace to obtain the required amount. If there is no furnace nearby, it places one from the inventory. If there is no crafting table nearby, it places one from the inventory. Finally, it crafts the iron boots and sends a chat message.

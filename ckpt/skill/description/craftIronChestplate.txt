async function craftIronChestplate(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron chestplate using 8 iron ingots. It checks if there are enough iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines iron ores and smelts them in a furnace to obtain the required amount. It then checks if there is a crafting table nearby or in the inventory, and if not, it places one from the inventory. Finally, it crafts the iron chestplate using the crafting table and announces the success.
